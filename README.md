# Hello

I specialize to create complex solutions for business.
Backend developer with strong knowledge of:
- ORMs,
- Database,
- Architectures, 
- Patterns,
- Cloud,
- Docker and deploy,
- Microservices

I focus on clear and simple code. I prefer the minimalist work system. I confess rule "less is more".
I'm fascinated books and automotive.

Do you have any questions? 
I'm ready to help you :)

I'm interesting in: books, cycling, cars, motocycles and fast code
